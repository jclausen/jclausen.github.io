        <p>Isaac over at Parabasis <a href="http://parabasis.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/should-you-major-in-drama.html">posed an important question</a> yesterday which I think deserves response: <a href="http://parabasis.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/should-you-major-in-drama.html">Should you major in drama</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://parabasis.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/should-you-major-in-drama.html"><p>
I ask you dear readers to weigh in on this. I was a drama major, and I go back and forth as to whether or not this was a good idea (nothing against Vassar's Drama Department, which was quite good, and I'm happy I did a liberal arts drama program and not a conservatory one).  I think part of this question gets to the root of an even deeper question: What is a college major for? Is it meant to be vocational training, in which case all liberal arts study fails the test unless all liberal arts students are planning on going into academia?  Is it, as David Foster Wallace postulated, to literally teach us how to think?  Is it to create a society where people at their jobs have a wide variety of perspectives and backgrounds, and thus the disconnect between major and job is a feature not a bug? Why college at all?
</p></blockquote>
<h3>I responded in his comments, but for the sake of posterity, I'll publish it here:</h3>
<hr />

<p>Here's my background to give you sense of where I'm coming from: Went to a state University as a drama major for two years, transferred to a big city conservatory and had to drop out due to finances after a year. I never finished my BFA.<br /></p>
<p>I then went on to chase carrots and climb ladders very successfully with Fortune 100 company for 15 years. Not wanting to live with regrets, I made a conscious decision to avoid looking back. That strategy worked for a time. One day I'd had enough, gracefully "retired" and today I'm back finishing up that degree with plans for an MFA after that.<br /></p>
<p>While a drama degree will never be a notch on the resume for the board of directors or shareholders, I can say that every promotion, every new job (role if you will), my experience in the theatre was a key component to my success. Here's three reasons why:<br /></p>
<ol>
<li>True dedication to the arts - like that required in a top-notch drama program - requires a ton of hard work, long hours, the ability to prioritize, and tremendous sacrifice. If you have the ability to do these three things, you have a leg up on most others around you in any situation outside of the arts.</li>
<li>Succeeding in business, as in many other fields requires both keen self-awareness and the ability to present yourself to others. That's pretty much what is required to be successful in a highly competitive drama program at a university.</li>
<li>Life is competitive - like it or not. You will win some and lose some but it is how you handle both that defines your character to others in your field. Anyone serious about committing themselves to the arts has to learn to deal with the inherent competition in healthy ways or they risk losing it all within their community.</li>
</ol>
<p>I wholly agree with "Director" in that you should pursue what you are passionate about for as long as you are able to pursue it and for man of the same reasons he listed.<br /></p>
<hr />

<p>College is a time when your adult personality really begins to be forged and being able to feel passionate and energized about what you're doing on a daily basis has a way of bringing out the best in a person.<br />
