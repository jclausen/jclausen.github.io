        <p>
In a previous career, I was the manager of training and development for the upper midwest region of a large corporation.  Part of that responsibility was the training and implementation of the <a href="http://www.gallup.com/consulting/52/Employee-Engagement.aspx?gclid=CKiGg-mE_pICFSB7IgodZ0q-Bw">Gallup Employee Engagement Survey</a> - which is officially know as the Q12.   It is named such because of the twelve questions which make up the survey.  These questions have been refined through the years to provide an effective measurement of employee engagement in the workplace.   This is not to say that these questions measure happiness - though there are obvious correlations - but rather employees who are engaged and committed in their role in the organization.</p>
<p>
The questions are copyright of the Gallup Organization and a detailed analysis of each question can be found in the excellent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0684852861%26tag=blogezods-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0684852861%253FSubscriptionId=0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2"><cite>First, Break All the Rules: What the World's Greatest Managers Do Differently</cite> by Marcus Buckingham, Curt Coffman</a>, but for the sake of posterity the twelve questions (better termed as statements which employees rate from 1 to 4) used on the survey are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>I know what is expected of me at work.</li>
<li>I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right.</li>
<li>At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.</li>
<li>In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work.</li>
<li>My supervisor, or someone at work, seems to care about me as a person.</li>
<li>There is someone at work who encourages my development.</li>
<li>At work, my opinions seem to count.</li>
<li>The mission/purpose of my company makes me feel my job is important.</li>
<li>My associates (fellow employees) committed to doing quality work.</li>
<li>I have a best friend at work.</li>
<li>In the last six months, someone at work talked to me about my progress.</li>
<li>In the last year, I have had opportunities at work to learn and grow.</li>
</ol>
<p>
As may be evident, these questions are not entirely applicable to a student or volunteer environment, though it's arguable that they can be made to be.  Part of understanding the impact of these questions, however is to understand the journey of engagement which every employee goes through - in full or to a degree.   It is in this journey or what the Gallup School of Management refers to as the pyramid of employee engagement that I find very direct correlations in the director to actor/crew relationships of a theatrical production.</p>
<p>
<img src="/images/2008/04/employee-engagement.jpg" alt="employee-engagement.jpg" title="employee-engagement.jpg" align="right" /><br />
In essence, as any new employee enters a job or undergoes a significant change in job responsibilities they must answer the four "journey questions" for themselves in the affirmative.  There are four of them, and the questions of the Q12 are sub-segments of these four journey-based questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do I get?</li>
<li>What do I give?</li>
<li>Do I belong?</li>
<li>How can <em>we</em> grow? (emphasis mine)</li>
</ol>
<p>
In both my personal experience as an actor, and my more recent experience as a director, I continue to notice that the journey of an actor as they become part of an ensemble - a process which starts anew with each production (no matter how often the actors have worked together previously) - is identical.  In the workplace, if any one of these questions are not answered in the affirmative, full employee engagement is impossible.  Likewise, as we look at the journey and actor or member of a production crew makes in becoming part of a more powerful ensemble, if any one of these questions are not answered, the individual's engagement in the greater whole of the production is reduced.   In the next three segments, I will focus in on each of these questions and how they translate to the fundamental journey that every actor or member of a production crew makes through the course of the production.</p>
