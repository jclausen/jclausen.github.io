        <p><img src="/images/2008/04/employee-engagement.jpg" alt="employee-engagement.jpg" title="employee-engagement.jpg" align="right" />It is this final phase of <a href="http://www.gallup.com/consulting/52/Employee-Engagement.aspx?gclid=CKiGg-mE_pICFSB7IgodZ0q-Bw">the engagement journey</a> which most directors aspire to, but so seldom attain within the time frame of a production.  While we often speak of "creative teams" and "ensembles," saying that the actors an team assembled for a production are such doesn't necessarily make it so.</p>
<p>Gallup groups the following final questions of the Q12 into the the final ascent to the summit of this journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the last six months, someone at work talked to me about my progress.</li>
<li>In the last year, I have had opportunities at work to learn and grow.</li>
</ul>
<p>The time frame on these question has no direct correlation to the rehearsal process - a matter of weeks rather than years, but combine these questions into one question:  "In this production I have grown and progressed as an actor and have received valuable assistance in doing so from my director and peers" and  the lens of the questions becomes evident.</p>
<p>Frankly, given the length of time allocated for rehearsal through production, it is likely these questions will never be asked or answered until after the closing performance, however what is important is that if these questions are to be asked and answered, the actors and members of the production staff have moved beyond the lens of the previous steps of the journey - from the selfish into the realm selfless.  Many times, actors struggle with lines or individual elements of their performances and are unable to move beyond their own needs to participate in meeting the needs of the group.   This doesn't however prevent other members of the team from bringing these selfless elements to the ensemble as they each move beyond their own requirements for their respective performances.</p>
<p>It is the director's role to help facilitate the connections between actors, production staff, and to define their own relationships with the actors in a way that is meaningful and constructive.   None of the <a href="http://gmj.gallup.com/content/811/Feedback-Real.aspx">phases on this journey of engagement</a> suggest that conflicts and creative differences will not arise, but what they do offer are clear avenues of address to ensure that these conflicts and differences are addressed in manner which <em>encourages</em> engagement and selflessness, rather than setting back the process of achieving it.</p>
<p>While I am sure that the language used in the business world may be off-putting - even seem artificial - to those in artistic trades it is important to recognize the wisdom in meeting basic and central needs of individuals as part of the greater whole of creating a high-performing ensemble.</p>
