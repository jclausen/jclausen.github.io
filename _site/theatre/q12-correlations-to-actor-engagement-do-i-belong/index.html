<img src="/images/2008/04/employee-engagement.jpg" alt="employee-engagement.jpg" title="employee-engagement.jpg" align="right" />It is important to emphasize that each level of <a href="http://jonclausen.com/2008/04/q12-correlations-to-actor-engagement-introduction/">the engagement pyramid</a> builds on the underlying levels.  If at any point there becomes a disconnect in the ability of the individual to answer satisfactorily the questions in the previous levels, there is a negative impact on their ability to complete the higher levels of the journey.</p>
<p>
The third phase of the engagement journey - as relating Gallup's Q12 to the theatrical production process - is the actors ability to answer the question "Do I Belong?" in a way that is meaningful to them personally.   This is perhaps the trickiest part of the journey because if the actor is struggling with either script issues (i.e. - not connecting with the material, knowledge of lines, etc.) or feel an absence of support from other members of the production they will never answer this question to their satisfaction.   Gallup groups the following Q12 questions into this phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>At work, my opinions seem to count.</li>
<li>The mission/purpose of my company makes me feel my job is important.</li>
<li>My associates (fellow employees) committed to doing quality work.</li>
<li>I have a best friend at work.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Obviously the language of these questions is related to a work enviroment, but if we reframe the questions like this, it becomes much more applicable to the rehearsal and creative process:</p>
<ul>
<li>In rehearsal, my opinions seem to count.</li>
<li>The goal/purpose of my production makes me feel my role is important.</li>
<li>My fellow members of the production are committed to doing quality work.</li>
<li>I have a best friend in my production.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The question which causes the most consternation and misunderstanding by facilitators of the Q12 is the "I have a best friend..." question.  Note, however that the language of these questions is very specific and that "<em>a</em> best friend" is the operator as opposed to "<em>my</em> best friend."   It is not attempting to define friendships but rather a bond or connection with another member of the production that is meaningful.  It is those very relationships with other actors that allow the actor to power through the difficult phases of performance and accept corrective peer feedback in an open and accepting  manner.</p>
<p>
Most of all, this phase of the journey is a personal validation for the actor of the manner in which they feel their role provides a valuable function in the greater whole of the production.  It is the director's responsibility - regardless of cast size - to ensure that the individual members of the production understand their importance in the overall effect on the audience.  Unless this phase is answered satisfactorily, it is impossible for the ensemble to transform from a group of individual actors into a selfless, creative ensemble.</p>
