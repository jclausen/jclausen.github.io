        <p><img src="/images/2008/02/sp2008-sixcharacters-poster.jpg" alt="Poster - MSU Six Characters - Photo Courtesy MSU Theatre" align="right" />About a month ago, I checked the <a href="http://theatre.msu.edu/">MSU Theatre department website</a> and saw that they were staging Luigi Pirandello's <cite>Six Characters in Search of an Author</cite>.  After asking my wife to go with me to see it, I booked tickets.  Pirandello's work isn't produced nearly as often as it should be, and I was very excited to be able to catch a staging of it. After having to reschedule our original tickets from Friday night's performance because of a snowstorm, we made the hour-and-change drive to Lansing last night to see it.</p>
<p>Peter Brook - in his seminal book <cite>The Empty Space</cite> gives specifics to the concept of what he calls a Deadly Theatre in that:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is vain to pretend that the words we apply to classical plays like 'musical', 'poetic', 'larger than life', 'noble', 'heroic', 'romantic', have any absolute meaning.  They are the reflections of a critical attitude of a particular period, and to attempt to build a performance today to conform to these canons is the most certain road to deadly theatre...</p></blockquote>
<p>Revisitation of works which have period reference and language necessitate additional care and consideration when staging, especially when - in the case of <cite>Six Characters</cite>; much of the dialogue by the ensemble of 'theatre professionals' is brought about through improvisation.  MSU made the choice to use a recent adaptation of the play by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brustein">Robert Brustein</a>, which had been <a href="http://www.amrep.org/people/bob.html">previously performed by ART to rave reviews and accolades</a>.  As such, the foundation for a meaningful staging which resonates with a modern audience existed.</p>
<p>I hesitate to spend a great deal of time on the specific dialogue brought about through improv or any specifics of acting, since I believe that many of the disconnects in these elements were ones which the director should have exercised a strong hand and the cast, while complicit to a degree, should not be held entirely accountable - especially as student actors. What needs to be highlighted, however, this very lack of a strong hand and a clear perspective of the ends to be achieved was evident to a 'deadly' fault.</p>
<h5>Characterization/Casting</h5>
<p>The MSU program, issued at the door, chose to highlight which members of the cast and crew were part of the BFA/MFA programs at the University, which - in my opinion - immediately induces in the audience the expectation that these annointed few are the "good" actors we should keep our eye on - the others being secondary.  What this did highlight, however, was the inherit nepotism in the casting choices - especially in a piece designed to be delivered by strong ensemble group.  It was clear that the casting choices in the production were made by line count, not by how those actors would fit and become believable as part of the greater ensemble.  I'm not speaking of the non-traditional, race-blind, casting choices here.  Those were not a problem in the least.  What I am speaking of is that the physical and vocal characteristics of any one actor create immediate power relationships in the minds of the audience toward the rest of the cast.</p>
<p>When the audience struggles to understand the relationship between the characters because of these casting choices - especially in a work which can be confusing to the audience from the start - the burden falls back to the director and to a lesser degree the actors - to make sure those relationship are quickly established through all available means.  When the work is to be performed in a Studio theatre environment - in the round no less - physical relationships between actors become amplified as the eyes of the audience are constantly re-creating and re-establishing the relationships between the ever-present, ever-visible ensemble.</p>
<p>Clearly, the actress chosen to play the Stepdaughter was the most powerful vocally and physically - in all probability why she might be cast in a role with a very high line count.  Though understandable in theory - based on the importance of the role - her vocal and physical power in comparison to the rest of the cast, made the parts of the director (which was cast as a female part in this production - Pirandello writes it as male part) and the mother, weaker to the point of disbelief.  The character of the Director, through no fault of her own, was permanently upstaged by the physical presence of the stepdaughter - a part which derives a great deal of it's effectiveness as a victim of circumstance.</p>
<p>The character of the Mother was dwarfed physically and vocally as well.   This could have played effectively had the mother been played with <em>strong</em> weakness - the way one might imagine someone like Dame Judy Dench playing the part of a long-suffering and emotionally weak matron.</p>
<p>In my opinion, a reversal of the casting of the Director and the Stepdaughter would have help to balance the physical relationships on the stage in a more believable way and would have helped the audience to establish those relationships earlier.  The earlier the audience can grasp the relationships of the characters upon entrance, the more quickly the dialogue delivered by them begins to take on meaning.</p>
<p>I won't spend much time on the actor chosen to play the role of the Father.  Vocally and physically, he was appropriate for the role, however his apparent need to accentuate each line through hand (and arm) gestures became an irritating liability - something the director should have recognized as one can only find a finite number of hand gestures before they begin to repeat and lose meaning (humans easily fall into patterns of repetition).</p>
<p>I often sensed that the actor sacrificed believability in delivering his lines for the sake of maintaining his pre-determined posture for his character; he frequently acted the attitude, rather than the actual dialogue, of his character.  Had the director been able to suppress his leading man's distracting gesticulation and assisted him in finding the meaning of his lines, both the actor and his role of the Father might have been capable of overcoming other weaknesses in production.</p>
<h5>Dialogue/Diction</h5>
<p>When faced with elements of the production - like those described above - which increase the difficulty for the audience to suspend disbelief, every inconsistency becomes more apparent.  As my wife said on the ride home, "You can't talk about iPods and g-strings and then use words like 'perhaps' a moment later. Just say 'maybe.'"</p>
<p>In Pirandello's original, the setting is a professional theatre.  The MSU production chose to modify this setting to be one of a student production.   This could have worked fine, however, numerous pop-culture references derived through (I'll assume) improv eventually have to yield to the written dialogue of the play.  It is perfectly reasonable, in a play that allows a great deal of flexibility in dialogue, to take liberties with context for the purpose of providing a more familiar environment for the audience.</p>
<p>The fact that the Six Characters speak in period fashion - which ironically was written by Pirandello to be very realistic in its day - can actually work, if one establishes that these Characters have been searching for many years toward their resolution.  Though opposite of way Pirandello intended when he authored the play, the contrast between the more formal dialogue of the Characters and the more modern expressions used by the Actors and Director could actually provide important and meaningful contrast in production.</p>
<p>If one, however, attempts to modernize the setting, then there is a corresponding need to modernize or ensure believability of the written dialogue which was, in fact, written for another time and place. Since the majority of scripted lines for the "real" characters are delivered by the (character of the) Director, the characterization of this role is of utmost importance.  Played with more force and more pompousity, the Director character could effectively deliver period dialog.  In this staging, however, the youthful energy of the actress playing the Director only served to amplify the disconnect between her lines of improv and her written lines.</p>
<h5>Spectacle/Scenery</h5>
<p>Staging this production in a studio theatre with the audience positioned 360 degrees around the stage would pose problems for any director.  While these constraints can certainly be overcome, it does however increase the importance on choosing an appropriate setting for the action to develop.</p>
<p>In Pirandello's original stage directions, the audience is witness to the flying in of elaborate backdrops and the rolling in of ornate set pieces - such as the fountain for the end scene - and visible lighting changes to evoke mood. As such, the illusion of the theatre is held transparent for the audience to see.  Clearly the technical capabilities of the space places a limit to these possibilities, however the choice of set pieces could have provided the appropriate contrast.</p>
<p>The set elements used in production were naturalistic in style and plain.  While this is fitting with the dialogue provided of "using available materials" the limitations of the performance space would probably necessitate a higher degree of theatricality in the pieces and furniture brought to the stage.  Had the designer instead chosen to use set pieces with visible texturizing, ornate elements which distract, even pieces which might be easily associated with certain productions (i.e. - Small palm trees which might have been a set piece for <cite>South Pacific</cite>) might have helped to contrast the "theatricality" of what the Director and her Actors were attempting to reproduce.</p>
<p>The Characters themselves call attention to this contrast and more deliberate and elaborate choices by the designer would have served to enhance this dialogue rather than obscure it.  The benefit for the designer is that this play provides a perfect example for one, normally constrained by the need to keep distraction at a minimum, to intentionally create distraction from the action towards a very specific end.</p>
<h5>Themes/Take-aways</h5>
<p>This work traffics heavily in themes of nearly existential reality versus illusion, truth versus fiction.  That being said, it is not meant to be staged as "theatre of the absurd".   The staging choices, when combined as a whole, lent themselves to an audience response more appropriate to a work such as Ionesco's <cite>The Bald Soprano</cite> than any of the works of Pirandello; his dialogue is written with the purpose of <em>evoking</em> reality rather than distancing itself from it.  It is in this critical failure of thematic resolution that the play's end failed to reach it's intended effect.</p>
<p>The director chose, for the ending, a moment where the (character of the) Director, upon questioning the reality of what she has seen, discovers the doll of the drowned and disappeared little girl in the fountain.  She then sits down on the edge of the fountain in a frozen tableau, gazing at the doll upon her knees.  House lights, are turned on, and the audience pauses for a moment as they wonder whether the play is complete - then exits with the actor frozen in tableau.</p>
<p>This staging choice has tremendous potential for power and could ably have served to land the thematic premise of the entire work.  The danger, however, is that unless the price has been paid by actors and accepted by the audience through the previous hour and a half (this staging was performed with no intermission) the audience begins to rise with a feeling of annoyance of the overt trickery of this ending - rather than in awe of it's power to provoke those questions which might be derivative.</p>
<p>Members of the audience began to shift, reach for coats with uncertainty, and finally one or two lead the rest in the decision that the play had ended.  The actor in tableau, rather than an embodiment of all they had witnessed, becomes instead a blatant theatrical element, indicative of a performance which failed to meet it's promise.  What aspires to be holy becomes, instead, the deadliest which live theatre can offer: an acute awareness of the time spent in this space in an aborted rite of communion with others now aware of the same.</p>
<p>I remained mostly silent on my thoughts of the production as my wife and I walked back to the car - not wanting to be overheard by family members or students who might have been hurt by my words.  Once in the car, I said to her, "I hope you know how much I appreciate you going to see this with me, even if it means we had to see bad theatre tonight."  "Thank god!" she exclaimed.  "I thought maybe it was just me - that I just didn't get it." I assured her that was not supposed to be the point.  Instead it seemed apparent that it was perhaps the director who "didn't get it" and, as such, let both their actors and audience down.  That may be a bit harsh and I'm sure the individual who takes ownership of the staging must be a capable individual, but the fact remains that the majority of the failures in this production fall squarely on the shoulders of the director, before inevitably cascading on to the cast and crew.</p>
<p>MSU's website - and its playbill - states the artistic mission of it's department is "To provoke and sustain interest in the theatre as a source of truth and insight into the human condition."  If one is determined to take on Pirandello for his "truth and insight" one must be willing to take into account that engagement with the "human condition" of it's audience is the transaction which ultimately must be completed.</p>
