        <p>Technically this was my second read of the play since my first was back in the early nineties.  The script has stayed with me through four states and countless moves, but when a list of seven scripts from which to choose a 25 minute cutting for my Directing II final project was offered, it was <em>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, by Edward Albee</em> I chose.</p>
<p>There is something fascinating, even scintilating, about dramatic literature which uses common circumstance as hook to make us uncomfortable.  Pinter and Osbourne are masters of this.  Albee is a guru - and much more subtle in the way he approaches both the hooks and the levels of discomfort.</p>
<p>George and Martha, the two main characters of <em>WAVW</em> are eerily representative of thousands of marriages of dysfunction - underlying resentments, feelings of bitterness, mutual distain, etc.   What makes them unique enough for the stage is one major exception:  the removal, by the playwright, of the filtering devices which keep those disfunctions "civil" and under control.</p>
<p>With liberal doses of alcohol and the catalyst of uninvited (and invited) guests, Albee drives George and Martha to the brink of marital disaster.  George and Martha wage a war in three acts which spares no one and nothing until, like a pair of prize fighters circling in exhaustion, one must deliver the knockout blow. Though the play is Martha's the blow is delivered by George.</p>
<p>George and Martha, in their disappointment, have created a fantasy life together with one fundamental rule:  tell no one.   When Martha violates this rule and proceeds to commit blatant infidelity in front of him, George determines that his ultimate response is to end the fantasy by "killing" their child.</p>
<p>Albee's core theme in Virginia Woolf is the preference which we sometimes hold for fantasy versus reality and the way in which the perpetuation of these fantasys assures destruction.  In the primary case of this play, marriage is the metaphor, but the theme spirals outward to other elements of the play and beyond.  Nick maintains a fantasy of his work and it's value while ignoring possible negatives.  Honey created a fantasy pregnancy in order to force Nick to marry her.   Martha created a fantasy of who George was and would be and fell in love with that fantasy, versus his actuality.</p>
<p>In the context of history, Who's <em>Afraid of Virgina Woolf</em> was most definitely a response to late-fifties era, middle class, attitudes about marriage, common happiness, and the benefits of science.   There is a relevance today, in re-examining this theme afresh as Americans would be well served examine our own collective "fantasies" of success, country, and where we perceive our self on the curve of greater equality for all.</p>
