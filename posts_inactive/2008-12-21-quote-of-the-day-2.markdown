<p><blockqoute>"An actor on the stage need only to sense the smallest modicum of organic or physical truth in his action or general state and instantly his emotions will respond to his inner faith in the genuineness of what his body is doing."<br/>- Konstantin Stanislavsky, <cite>Creating a Role</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Creating this general state and action is, to a large degree the responsibility of the director.</p>
