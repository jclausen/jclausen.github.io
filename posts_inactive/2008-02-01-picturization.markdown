<p>It occurred to me the other day, as I was working on an in-class exercise for Directing I, that creating pictures on stage comes fairly easily to me.   Of course, you could say it's the influence of my artist wife, my flirtations with film and photography through the years, or some other such thing, but a <a href="http://digg.com/comics_animation/Take_10_Greatest_X_Men">post over at Digg</a> (the fact of which I dugg it reveals me to be more of a dork than you thought already) today got me thinking that I may have an idea of how this strength came about:  comic books.   Though more akin to the way we see film, a (good) comic book still is all about using a picture to create dramatic tension.</p>
<p>I was a big collector of the X-Men comics back in my pre-teen and early teenage years and happened to be so during the tenure of some of the greatest artists to work on that series, specifically <a href="http://www.coverbrowser.com/covers/uncanny-x-men/5">the covers of John Romita Jr</a>.</p>
<p>Who says comic books are mindless entertainment that rot your mind?</p>
