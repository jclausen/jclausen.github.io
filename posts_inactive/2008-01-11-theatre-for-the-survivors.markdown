I find it fascinating when a play is written which attempts to depict the life of a recently deceased subject with living relatives.   One example, Robert Brustein's <cite>Nobody Dies on Friday</cite> can elicit <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990DE5D61F3DF93AA25757C0A96E958260">a very public backlash from critics and family members alike</a>.  <a href="http://amrep.org">ART's</a> new production of <cite><a href="http://amrep.org/copenhagen/">Copenhagen</a></cite> has for it's subject Werner Heisenberg.  In this case, the family is thrilled, as attested to by <a href="http://amrep.wordpress.com/2008/01/11/an-email-from-heisenbergs-son/#more-298">an email from Heisenberg's son, Jochen</a>.  From the <a href="http://amrep.wordpress.com/">ART blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This afternoon Kati Mitchell, our Director of Press and Public Relations, received a wonderful email from Jochen Heisenberg, Werner Heisenberg’s son, a professor of physics at the University of New Hampshire. Mr. Heisenberg attended Wednesday night’s performance of Copenhagen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://amrep.wordpress.com/2008/01/11/an-email-from-heisenbergs-son/">Read the letter here</a>.  Whether a work of art is reviled or revered by the family may not, and perhaps <em>should not</em> be a central concern for the author, director, and actors, but let's face it:  reality and the feelings of survivors are going to enter into the mix at some point.  This is bound to shape the artistic choices in the production - for the better, and possibly for the worse.</p>
