<p>Interesting goings on over the pond as <a href="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/news/story/0,,2238982,00.html">Britain faces a crisis of arts participation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Sir Brian McMaster's long-awaited assessment of how to encourage excellence in the arts marks a significant change from how it is currently funded and managed. Instead of measuring success through "targetology" and "box-ticking", there should be more judgment, more self-assessment and more input from artists themselves, he says.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>IMHO, his proposal may help in the short term but merely stems the tide on what I see as an identity crisis for the arts(more on that theme later).</p>
<p>UPDATE: More on this as <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/theatre/2008/01/arts_cuts_debate_continues_onl.html">Equity and others weigh in</a></p>
