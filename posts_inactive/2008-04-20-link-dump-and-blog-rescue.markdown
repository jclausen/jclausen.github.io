<p>It's been far too long since I updated Between Silences.   Such is the nature of the beast when one has too many irons in the fire.   While I've continue to mark and place posts on interesting topics in draft status, I just haven't gotten back to editing, commenting, and posting them here. </p>
<p>As such, here's a quick link dump of some interestingness from the past two months that will, at the very least, get me back to zero:</p>

<dt><a href="http://www.actorsinequity.org/index.html"><cite>Welcome to Actors' Inequity: A Parody with a Purpose</cite></a></dt>
<dd>
<blockquote>We celebrate the actors, musicians, dancers, singers and entertainers of the world who perform for the sheer joy of it. Those who carry an Actors' Inequity card carry a statement that says, "I have a day job."</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm thinking of getting my own card..</p>

<dt><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/us/21smoke.html?_r=1&ex=1364097600&en=cdb8cd0bcd04c289&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin"><cite>In Colorado, ‘No Smoking’ Means Exactly That, Even on Stage</cite></a></dt>
<dd>It's kind of hard to imagine plays of the theatrical cannon like<cite>Death of a Salesman</cite> performed without smoking, but such is the way of the world...<br/><br/>
<dd>
<dt><a href="http://www.forward.com/articles/13080/">American Theatre Proposes that it might be acceptable to punish Israeli artists for the actions of their government</a></dt>
<dd>Yeah, I thought it was a stupid idea too, but it sure stirred up a hornets nest:</p>
<blockquote><p>When American Theatre Magazine asked a small group of theater artists to pen statements on their views of a proposed Israeli cultural boycott, representatives of the magazine thought they were asking a mere dozen or so people. But when one of the respondents took the survey a step further, circulating it to an e-mail list and eliciting a flurry of fiery responses from a wide swath of the theater community, a small maelstrom ensued.</p></blockquote>

<dt><a href="http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2008/04/tracy-letts.html"><cite>August: Osage County</cite> wins Pulitzer for Drama</a></dt>
<dd>Well deserved indeed, though Chris Jones, from <a href="http://chicagotribune.com">the Trib</a>, goes there and <a href="http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2008/04/would-tracy-let.html">asks whether the play would have won</a> without the outstanding ensemble work and abilities of the actors who brought the production from workshop, to Steppenwolf, to Broadway.<br/><br/>

<dt><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/10/arts/music/10cand.html?_r=1&ex=1365652800&en=2bb79acb543afd6e&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin"><cite>‘Candide’ the Opera (or Is It a Musical?) Returns to NY City Opera</cite></a></dt>
<dd>I'm still going to call it a musical.  <cite>Candide</cite> for all it's tremendous difficulties to produce (e.g. - incredibly difficult songs, tongue-in-cheek entirety of plot, etc) is my favorite musical (or Opera if you prefer) for many reasons.  I was fortunate to see the Guthrie Theatre's production of it back in the early nineties and was blow away - though I continue to appreciate it more with age.  Voltaire's irony is well served by Berstein's score and the lyrics.  The challenge for the actors is to maintain the semblance of complete sincerity of their characters, while "playing light" enough to let the audience laugh.  I have mixed feelings with an Opera company's staging of <cite>Candide</cite>, but I wish them well.<br/><br/>
