<p>Someday...</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to direct one half of a two director, non-traditional, casting of <cite>The Homecoming</cite> in repertory.  There's something in this play - disturbing by itself - that seems to allow it to be played as a comedy or drama and also would lend it self well to two contrasting versions side by side.  I think a non-traditional casting of the two would open up some interesting paths for both the audience and the creative team.</li>
</li>
<li>I would like to get my MFA in Directing from The Theatre School or Yale School of Drama.</li>
<li>I would like to direct Richard III.</li>
<li>I might like to act and sing in Les Miserables.</li>
<li>I would like to facilitate a meaningful conversation between a company of fine actors and an audience over a period of years and explore the ways in which they grow together in tastes and interpretation.</li>
<li>I would like to take a verse speaking workshop or class from Cic Berry.</li>
<li>I would like to take a Shakespeare course or workshop from Gary Taylor or Harold Bloom.</li>
</ul>
