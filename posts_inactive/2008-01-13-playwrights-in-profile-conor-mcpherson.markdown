<p>Excellent profile from <a href="http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2008/01/conor-mcpherson.html">Chicago Tribune on Conor McPherson</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This is the muse and the stomping ground of the 36-year-old writer Conor McPherson, whom a growing number of American critics now consider the greatest living Irish playwright (maybe excepting Brian Friel, maybe not) and who lives right around the corner from the Royal Marine with his wife, painter Fionnuala Ni Chiosain.</p>
<p>All of McPherson's plays -- an astonishing body of work that includes "The Weir," "Port Authority," "Dublin Carol," "St. Nicholas," "This Lime Tree Bower," "Shining City" and "The Seafarer" -- take place within a few miles of this spot.</p>
<p>Even though he's far better known on Broadway than on Irish streets he traverses in total anonymity, McPherson is not unlike this place
