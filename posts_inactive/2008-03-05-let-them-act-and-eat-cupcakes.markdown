<p><a href="http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2008/03/adult-theater-w.html">An absolutely fabulous idea</a> from the Victory Gardens theatre in Chicago:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2008/03/adult-theater-w.html"><p>
Retailers like Ikea do it. So do gyms. So do casinos. And now, finally, a major Chicago theater is offering parents a chance to attend a Chicago show aimed at adults without having to find and budget for a babysitter.<br />
<br/><br/><br />
If you want to see Joel Drake Johnson's new comedy "Four Places" at the Victory Gardens Theater next month, you can bring your kids along to the weekend matinee shows April 12 and 13. While you're in the theater, Victory Gardens' "education professionals" will keep your kids (between 5 and 12 years old) entertained with theater games and storytelling in the room right upstairs.Â  As an added incentive, everyone gets free cupcakes.
