<p>In my years of living in Chicago, I drove past the abandoned Uptown Theatre more than a few times.  I wasn't aware of it's history and frankly the broken bulbs on the marquee and it's rundown appearance didn't lead me to believe it was anything special.  It turns out that it is.  Quite.   <a href="http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2008/01/the-uptown-thea.html">The Theater Loop has the view that things might be looking up</a> for <a href="http://www.uptowntheatre.com/index.html">the Uptown</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Its challenges are well known — terrible state of disrepair, a location outside of downtown, parking issues, massive size, and so on. But its assets — most notably an interior that stirs the soul — are just as worthy of attention.</p>
<p>There have been various rumblings of late involving Jam Productions, which has an interest in the facility, and Clear Channel Entertainment, which is itself in a state of flux but reportedly is chatting with the city about the joint. I don't know what's going to happen. But there's probably more reason to feel optimistic about the Uptown than at any other time in years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also a <a href="http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2008/01/the-uptown-thea.html">neat video with the above post</a> showing the interior of the theatre - which is stunning to say the least.  Unfortunately, being a bit familiar with Chicago and it's pattern of gentrification, short of a declaration of historic status, the theatre is in such a terrible location in relation to Chicago's arts corridor that it may be a stretch to see it renovated before disrepair becomes irrevocable decay.:(</p>
