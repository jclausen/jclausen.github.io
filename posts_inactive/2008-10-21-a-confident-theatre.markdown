<p>My musing: Today much of what is produced in the theatre - especially that done at the community level -  is presented to the public as an apology from apologists:  "We're sorry this isn't a film, with one of your favorite stars, but please come and see it anyway."   The question which arises for me in all of this is whether one can make truly outstanding theatre if one does not believe the theatre is a superior medium for their product.</p>
<p>I propose that it's less a matter of which medium is superior than which audience experience is superior.  This may change on the material being presented, but needs to be asked again, and again, and again.</p>
