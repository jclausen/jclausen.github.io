<img class="left" src="/images/jon_headshot_md.jpg" alt="My photo" width="225px"/>Hi! I'm Jon.  If you're looking for my professional resume, go [here](http://silowebworks.com/about/]) or look [here](http://silowebworks.com/solutions/sub-contract/) if you want to vet out the tech stuff I know.  

I was born and raised in the tall grasses and open skies of South Dakota - well not literally *in* the tall grasses, but you get the drift.  My interests:  theatre, learning, technology, problem solving, and the outdoors - though the order of importance may vary by time of year.

This is my thinkspace.  
----------------------

After maintaining and developing on a number of different blogs (theatre, tech, personal, politics, etc.) and platforms over the years, I'm finally consolidating them all in to one big old diverse mish-mash of a blog.  That's how my mind operates, for the most part, so I figured I'd put it all out there...  Somtimes I'm brief, sometimes verbose, often introspective, quite a bit artsy and randomly philosophical.  

Under the hood

Today, we're running on [Jekyll][] and [GitHub Pages][].  Keeps me on my toes with Ruby, since most of my work days are spent writing in CFML and PHP and, plus, it makes jotting things down easy since I have a text editor open all day anyway.
