<p>Both content and context of this site should be regarded as "in flux."   </p>
<p>The creation of this site stems from the need to maintain a consolidated collection of my work and observations on the theatre, yet is not limited by that topic.  </p>
<p>It's purpose,simply, is a tool for journaling and collecting while I return to my studies after a time away from acting and the theatre.</p>
