<blockquote><p>
  That dream is dead. The theaters endure, but the repertory companies they stood for have been long disbanded. When regional theaters need artists today, they outsource: They ship the actors, designers, and directors in from New York and slam them together to make the show. To use a sports analogy, theaters have gone from a local league with players you knew intimately to a different lineup for every game, made of players you'll never see again, coached by a stranger, on a field you have no connection to.</p>
<p>  Not everyone lost out with the removal of artists from the premises. Arts administrators flourished as the increasingly complex corporate infrastructure grew. Literary departments have blossomed over the last few decades, despite massive declines in the production of new work. Marketing and fundraising departments in regional theaters have grown hugely, replacing the artists who once worked there, raising millions of dollars from audiences that are growing smaller, older, and wealthier. It's not such a bad time to start a career in the theater, provided you don't want to actually make any theater.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As someone who spent over a decade in management for a Fortune 100 company, once you build the bureaucracy to support an institution, it's damn tough to cull it later. All the more reason, regional and and educational theatre needs to think lean, mean, and - most of all - about how it will maintain it's meaningful conversation with it's audience if the artists who make it all worthwhile leave for greener pastures.</p>
