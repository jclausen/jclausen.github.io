<p><a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/theatre/2008/01/rehearsals_are_for_actors_not.html">Guardian theatre blog takes on</a> the subject of whether rehearsals should allow audiences:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Nicholas Hytner's suggestion that rehearsals of plays should be "visible and accessible" to the public will have instantly tightened the sphincter of every actor in Britain.</p>
<p>Hytner is well known for thinking "outside the box". Indeed, his extraordinary ability to carry his troops through innovative and often terrifying processes of change is what has made his tenure at the National Theatre so stupendously successful. But rehearsals open to the public?</p>
<p>The prospect is terrifying. Families wandering through in lengthy crocodiles, parents with headphones clamped to their ears pumping out background commentaries: "The play being rehearsed is one of Chekhov's finest. Unfortunately that middle-aged actor/writer from north London who said he could play the mandolin in order to get the role is sadly deficient, which is why he's holding the instrument the wrong way up while the director is staring thunderously at him from the corner.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I know that Peter Brook has tackled this question before and I tend to agree with him.  What is gained in accessibility to the work and the creative process is lost in the ability of the actors and the creative team to approach the rehearsal period an an open and un-self-conscious way.</p>
<p>That being said, I think the <a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/">RSC</a> has done an excellent job addressing the question by <a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/explore/workspace/richard3_2688.htm">filming some of their rehearsal practices</a>.   The debate could be had about the camera's intrusion accomplishing the same negatives as the physical presence of the audience, but I believe that after a time that would go away. Allowing the actors to have some say in what was published might be a way to minimize even that impact.</p>
