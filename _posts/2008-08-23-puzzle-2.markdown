<p><em>by Jonathan Clausen</em></p>
<p>Deliver me in a box of many colors.<br />
Empty this image atomized<br />
to the pleasure of your gaze.<br />
Inspect my jagged edges toward this<br />
decoration of your achievement.<br />
My garments cease to exist.<br />
For now, their beauty is a challenge<br />
to be met and won.<br />
The seams of my gilded robe,<br />
simply clues to something<br />
recognizable as a chance for recognition<br />
of intellect, not artistry.<br />
Frame me not with glue and mitred corners.<br />
Instead, savor my complete complexity.<br />
Then destroy me,<br />
as I am neither puzzle nor puzzling.</p>
