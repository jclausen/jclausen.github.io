<p>I'm catching up on posting old clippings.  This one, from <a href="http://www.buzzine.com/2008/11/empathy-for-the-devil/">Buzzine</a> hit me at the time and, as I reread it and reflect, I find it contains a great deal of truth:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.buzzine.com/2008/11/empathy-for-the-devil/"><p>
Sympathy and empathy are also primary channels that most traditional theatre uses to affect audiences, stretching back to Ancient Greece. Theatre is the most human of art forms. It involves a group of people gathering together to watch other people in real time in shared space. This act of communion is key to theatre’s power. The performers and the audience make an unspoken social compact that the audience will use their imagination and suspend their disbelief, and the actors will reward them with a fulfilling experience. This means that the audience must work along with the actors to ensure the night is a success. Part of the audience’s side of the bargain is that they will empathically bond with the characters on stage, to some extent, and part of the actor’s side of the bargain is that they will, to some extent, engage the audience’s empathy.<br/><br/>This is part of why watching bad theatre is so excruciating. Not only are you being let down by the guy on the other side of the bargaining table, but you also, on some level, feel bad for him that he and the show around him are failing so miserably.

<p>Those of us who love theatre as an artistic medium tend to support bad theatre because we don't want to lose the possibility of experiencing that exquisite engagement that is both addictive and infrequent.  Of course, bad theatre is a relative term but, even if we continue to support our local institutions, we should be as passionate about elevating the quality of our local and regional stages as we are about perpetuating the medium.  No one benefits by saying a thing is good when it's not.</p>
