<p>Polished exquisitely smooth from the hardest of stone,<br />
when etched by focused light becomes rough again,<br />
a wall built high, with moulding of annuals<br />
and carpets of green and grey.</p>
<p>
Endless panels of names,<br />
are all that today remains from this conflict:<br />
one which galvanized a generation,<br />
creating bitter enemies from the closest of kin.<br />
That time is forty years past for some,<br />
yet, for others, the stale acrimony of yesterday<br />
carries the taste of sweet youth<br />
into this present.</p>
<p>
In a fervent quest for absolution<br />
from grief, from guilt perhaps,<br />
we build these walls.<br />
We erect a marble buttress<br />
against the tides of wasted lives<br />
and, in doing so, make heroes and victims one,<br />
as if might could emerge from misbegotten history.</p>
<p>
Pilgrims to this monument<br />
bring their own questions,<br />
their own struggles with impending sleep<br />
and what lies after.<br />
“In the enclosure of death’s darkness,<br />
can one still move towards this light?”</p>
<p>
Perhaps we should ask the flowers here.<br />
They wither in the coolness of autumn.<br />
All too soon, like namesakes engraved upon this wall,<br />
they will be no more of this earth.<br />
Do not be sad;<br />
we will plant more again next year.</p>
