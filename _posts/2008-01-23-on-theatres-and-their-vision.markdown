<p>The article is titled <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/theatre/2008/01/theatre_needs_a_clear_vision.html">Theatre needs a clear vision</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
That said, do strong artistic policies really benefit theatres? After all, apart from critics, theatre junkies and Arts Council apparatchiks, who examines the newly announced schedules of the National, Royal Court or Bush looking for evidence of a clear vision or unified artistic programming? Don't normal people just find out that a play by a writer that they like - or starring an actor who they admire - is on, phone up, and book themselves tickets?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting questions.  It goes on to conclude that "The proof of strong artistic policies are the results, not a series of airy aims and claims."  Basically the premise being that the renewed success of both the Royal National Theatre and the Royal Court Theatre are based on strong leadership and artistic choices rather than any active outreach to their public.</p>
<p>On one hand I agree that strong leadership and artistic choices go along way.  On the other hand, I think the term "success" has varying definitions based on the type of theatre being referenced.  In Britain's for-profit theatres, there is still a strong state subsidization so critical success becomes the ultimate goal - the "for-profit" part acts as the financial ways and means for future success and the generated audiences from that acclaim fuel that.</p>
<p>In the not-for-profit theatre, there is an entirely different dynamic which comes to play.  I think it's important that not-for-profit theatres take care in applying the business model of Broadway to their own circumstances - especially as many are only a bad season or two away from folding.</p>
