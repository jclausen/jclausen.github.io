<p>Pictures in frames,<br />
taken in the days of their courtship,<br />
were taken down and placed in a drawer<br />
as keepsakes.</p>
<p>In the room where she would spend her nights alone<br />
remained a black and white photograph<br />
of a Venetian gondolier.<br />
His company would keep her <br />
in the dark hours of the morning.</p>
<p>In the room, where her lover slept,<br />
she sometimes glimpsed, in<br/> his sleeping face,<br />
the younger man of years before.<br />
She felt <br />
gratitude<br />
for their life together.</p>
<p>She returned, though,<br/> frequently,<br/>to the gondolier,<br />
imagining what might be revealed,<br />
should he,<br/> someday,<br/> pass out of<br />
their river of shadows.</p>
