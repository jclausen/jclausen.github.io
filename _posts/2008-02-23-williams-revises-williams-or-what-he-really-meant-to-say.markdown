<p>The new staging of <cite>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</cite> has some, who long for the nostalgic version they are familiar with from the 50's, up in arms because of an exponential increase in profanity and an unfamiliar ending.   Turns out Williams, himself, censored that version and updated it in the seventies with <a href="<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/23/theater/23cat.html?ex=1361422800&en=d9939b48fa380ec7&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">what he <em>really meant</em> to say</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Williams wrote &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; in 1954, but he made changes for the 1955 Broadway production in accordance with the wishes of the director, Elia Kazan.</p>
<p>Among the issues were how sympathetic the character of the sex-starved Maggie should be, and how much Brick, her neglectful husband, should change over the course of the play. A further altered version of that version was published by Dramatists Play Service in 1958.</p>
<p>The language in the first three lives of &quot;Cat&quot; is strong, but only as strong as would be allowed in the 1950s. Hence the presence of cute but weird modifiers like &quot;rutting&quot; and &quot;ducking.&quot; While Williams understood the compromises required for commercial success, he had reservations about the Broadway &quot;Cat,&quot; saying, in a 1973 interview with The New York Times, &quot;I was never happy about it.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1973 Williams revisited the play for a production at Stage West, a regional theater in Springfield, Mass. He produced a revision that combined elements of the 1955 Broadway version and his original version, restoring his preferred, ambiguous conclusion. He further tweaked it for a 1974 production at the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn.</p>
<p>He also, at this point, added the swearing. Or, more accurately, he put in what he clearly meant to say all along.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It turns out the director of one recent Broadway revival didn't even know there was an updated version by Williams:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Barry Weissler, who produced the 1990 Broadway revival, said he would never have included the four-letter word. &quot;Everything was implied, everything was aesthetic,&quot; he said. When told that it was Mr. Williams himself who put those words in there, Mr. Weissler seemed surprised. &quot;I didnâ€™t even know there were two versions,&quot; he said.<br />
<br/><br/><br />
Mr. Kahn thought the objections a little silly, considering the gothic ghastliness that forms the subject matter of many Tennessee Williams plays. But he heard the same protest, once, in 1974.

<p>Here's a production still from the 2008 staging starring James Earl Jones and Terrence Howard:</p>
