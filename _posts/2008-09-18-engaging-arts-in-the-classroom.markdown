<p>I've been reading the excellent book <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Engaging-Art-Transformation-Americas-Cultural/dp/0415960428%3FSubscriptionId%3D0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2%26tag%3Dblogezods-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0415960428">Engaging Art - The Next Great Transformation of America's Cultural Life</a></cite>, edited by <a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/curbcenter/staff">Stephen Tepper</a> and Bill Ivey, former head of the NEA. Though I'm only half way through the book, my intial reactions are that it is an essential book for anyone involved in arts production, exhibition, or planning.</p>
<p><cite>Engaging Art</cite> is a collection of essays and papers with a combined purpose of understanding the current cultural climate and offering opinions on what can be done to embrace the audience of today.  Since this is a topic that fascinates me, I'm clearly biased toward this type of discussion, however it occurred to me as I was reading last night that there is a clear need in academic programs for the arts to include discussions of the audience in their curriculum - e.g. a 400-level, inter-disciplinary seminar using this book as one of the reference sources. While the critical components of learning ones' craft are essential, part of becoming a contributing &quot;citizen of the arts&quot; is the inclusion of the audience in the presentation of that art - be it theatre, dance, gallery/museum, et all.</p>
<p>As our audiences evolve, so must those who make and present art evolve in the manner in which we engage them. Not change the art, but change the way we communicate with them about it and the ways in which we ask them to experience it.<br />
