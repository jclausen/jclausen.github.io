<p><em>by Jonathan Clausen</em></p>
<p>Brown eyed girls like me.<br />
Must be the blue in my own.</p>
<p>We always want what we don’t have.</p>
<p>Expressive, yet serious.  Intense, yet inviting.<br />
Capable of icy cool or glowing warmth.<br />
Did I mention I like brown-eyed girls too?</p>
<p>We always want what we don’t have.</p>
<p>That’s not always true, though.<br />
My shoulders are broad and square,<br />
capable of bearing great burdens.<br />
It would be nice, though, if things<br />
rolled off them more easily<br />
rather than fester and grow.<br />
Did I mention I have thin skin?</p>
<p>We always want what we don’t have.</p>
