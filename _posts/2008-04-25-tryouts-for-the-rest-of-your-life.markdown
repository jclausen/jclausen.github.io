<p>An interesting article from the Times on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/education/edlife/theater.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1366516800&amp;en=b5ed59699089acff&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin">the trials and tribulations of the collegiate audition process</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/education/edlife/theater.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1366516800&amp;en=b5ed59699089acff&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;oref=slogin"><p>

  THE road to stage and screen wasn’t always paved with sheepskin. Back in the 1970s, aspiring actors were "mentored into the profession," as Madeline Puzo, dean of the University of Southern California’s school of theater, puts it. The old-fashioned way was to get training in a professional theater company or an independent conservatory like the American Academy of Dramatic Arts or the Actors Studio, or to be discovered and plopped on the Hollywood treadmill.</p>
<p>  In 1970, only a handful of acting programs existed, all in the Northeast, according to Dramatics magazine, which is published by the Educational Theater Association. Today, more than 100 colleges and universities across the country offer conservatory training or B.F.A.’s. Several hundred more offer Bachelor of Arts degrees with majors in theater or acting, and concentrations in related areas like stage management, directing or scenic design.</p>
<p>  These days Peggy Sawyer, the "42nd Street" ingenue fresh off the bus from Allentown, Pa., would have a B.F.A. from Carnegie Mellon, the University of Michigan or the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University. She would have been trained in musical theater, schooled in the ways of the entertainment business and probably signed by an agent picked up at a senior-year showcase for show-business professionals.
