<p><a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/press/420_6620.aspx">Education outreach and interactivity</a> from the masters of NFP theatre:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.rsc.org.uk/press/420_6620.aspx"><p>
Now in its ninth successful year, the RSC's Playback is a performance project that encourages students to devise a short piece of theatre based on the themes and characters in Shakespeare's plays.<br />
On 3 April 2008, an INSET day for teachers was held at the Questors Theatre in Ealing. Led by Project Manager, Kate Hall and the Project Director, Gemma Fairlie, the day demonstrated exercises for teachers to engage students with the History plays whilst identifying themes within the text and giving examples of how Shakespeare's language can form the basis of the devised performances.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While not directly applicable to all NFP theatre environments, the lessons and the concepts are transferrable to a variety of degrees.</p>
