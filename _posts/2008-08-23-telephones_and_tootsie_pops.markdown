<p>by Jonathan Clausen</p>
<p>This is a poem to my Grandmother, Vivian<br />
who I have not called nor written on time<br />
for most of these thirty-five years on this earth.<br />
You’d wear purple someday,<br />
that’s what a picture said.<br />
Purple is nice.<br />
Makes me think of popsicles, Tootsie pops too.<br />
Grape soda is purple; so was the color<br />
of pajamas you once bought me at Christmas.<br />
I wanted the Dolphins, got Vikings instead,<br />
but jammies were yearly and next year brought teal<br />
and orange.</p>
<p>Purple’s also the color, of bruises I saw from a fall<br />
you’d taken while no one was around you at all,<br />
when last we visited.<br />
You asked for more syrup, more sweetness, it seemed,<br />
eyes stared toward some distance, you struggled to fight<br />
the shake of your morning.<br />
This vacant stare scared me, this I confess<br />
I’m not ready, you see, yet know all too well<br />
someday…</p>
<p>It’s from polio they say, a blight which once took<br />
hold of your body, in the past, in your youth.<br />
You beat it back then, though damage was done.<br />
Today you are stronger, but weaker, it seems,<br />
as you push yourself, still, in this race you must run.<br />
The phone rings.</p>
<p>Who lives 85 years? That’s what Grandpa once said.<br />
You planned a retirement, modest and yet<br />
today you are older than you thought you could be.<br />
The money is waning, the medicine wants.<br />
Your home’s now with strangers.</p>
<p>“Hello, Grandma” I answer, warm and exuberant.<br />
Salutations exchanged, pictures sent, and then<br />
a cough from pneumonia.<br />
You’ve beat it before; none of this causes worry.<br />
I tease you, you laugh, tell me you must go.<br />
It’s time for your dinner: farm cooking, no doubt.<br />
Your nurse is approaching, just a little time left<br />
for those few words which sum up quite clear<br />
your person, your goodness, you say:</p>
<p>“I’m proud of you, Jon. God bless and I love you<br />
too.”</p>
