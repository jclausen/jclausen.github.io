<p><a href="/images/2008/01/rsc_screen.jpg" title="RSC Screen - Thumb"><img align="right" src="/images/2008/01/rsc_screen_tn.jpg" alt="RSC Screen - Thumb" /></a>I have to commend the Royal Shakespeare Company in their use of new media (e.g. - Audio, Video, Interactive Activities) on <a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk">their website</a>.  They have done an outstanding job of presenting the body of their work in a way that makes it accessible to anyone, yet gives the viewer a strong desire for more - in this case their productions.   In addition, to support their position as a publicly funded institution, they also provide <a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/learning/">learning resources for teachers and students</a>. </p>
<p>They also have a running <a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/RSCPodcasts.xml">podcast of of Director Talks</a> as well as <a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/explore/">detailed exploration pages</a> for each of their productions.  The <a href="http://www.rsc.org.uk/explore/plays/richard3.htm">Richard III</a> page is a great example of this in providing video of production, rehearsal, photo galleries, and teachers resources.</p>
<p>I'm of the opinion that any theatre institution needs to be able to present it's work in an accessible and diverse manner which extends beyond the boundaries of the auditorium.  While the primary vehicle for delivering the art may be through the actors on the stage, the manner in which interest and exploration of works in production is created is as essential to the production itself in maintaining a healthy relationship, in essence an ongoing dialogue, with it's audience and supporters.</p>
