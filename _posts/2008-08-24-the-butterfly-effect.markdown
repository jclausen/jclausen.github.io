<p>A neat and, in some ways, inspiring story from WaPo about <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/15/AR2008081502356.html?hpid=features1&amp;hpv=national">a man and his...butterfly</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/15/AR2008081502356.html?hpid=features1&amp;hpv=national"><p>I decided to get the butterfly something to eat at the Smith &amp; Wollensky steakhouse across the street. My colleague Catherine Antoine and I plunged into the rush-hour traffic on 19th, slipping between cars that were jammed together waiting for the light to change. Neither the noise nor the fumes seemed to bother the butterfly.</p>
<p>I asked the waiter standing outside the door of the steakhouse to find a corner table for "me, my colleague and the butterfly."</p>
<p>"Right away, sir," responded the waiter, acting as if there was nothing extraordinary about a butterfly dropping in at a steakhouse. We ordered calamari and two glasses of pinot noir, and I asked the waiter to get something for the butterfly.</p></blockquote>
