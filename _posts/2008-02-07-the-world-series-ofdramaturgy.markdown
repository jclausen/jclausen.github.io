<p><a href="http://amrep.org">American Repertory Theatre</a> is in the process of producing <cite>Julius Ceasar</cite> and has not one, but <a href="http://amrep.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/welcome-to-the-world-series-of-dramaturgy/">four dramaturgs assisting on the production</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Working on Caesar feels like the World Series of Dramaturgy. A dramaturg&rsquo;s job shifts with every show, but our work on this production focuses on historical research. Somehow, each of the four (yes, four) of us “turging” Caesar are kept busy. On a typical show, the research centers on one time period. But Arthur Nauzcyiel&rsquo;s staging of Caesar takes place simultaneously in Caesar&rsquo;s Rome, Shakespeare&rsquo;s England, Kennedy&rsquo;s America, and the Loeb Stage of 2008. There&rsquo;s a never-ending supply of books, images, and audio to inform our work.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s so exciting about Arthur&rsquo;s Caesar is the subtle ways the production speaks to current events. From day one, it was made clear to the cast and staff that our modern tie-ins would be much deeper than Bush parodies and current military fatigues. The Kennedy Administration is the perfect metaphor. This week, my TV set was flooded with ads comparing JFK with Clinton and Obama, reminding me just how badly Americans want to be transported back to the days of Kennedy&rsquo;s Camelot.

<p>It will be interesting to watch how that process evolves.   It sounds a bit like, they are going for a mixed-bag of period analogue and traditional themes for the presentation - which may actually benefit from 4 different perspectives on the play.  On the flip side of that, though, intellectualizing it too much could certainly get in the way of both the actors and director picking a vision for the characters and production - and sticking with it.</p>
