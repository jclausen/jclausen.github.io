<p><em>by Jonathan Clausen</em></p>
<p>There is familiarity in this house,<br />
as if I’ve lived here before.<br />
It is perfectly imperfect<br />
in its infinite impossiblity of glory,<br />
yielding, instead, to a prarie-style practicality.</p>
<p>Its proximity of rooms is,<br />
at once, too close for comfort<br />
and just the right distance<br />
for keeping a watchful eye<br />
on curious toddlers.<br />
At times I am conflicted, whether to expand<br />
or to remain compact.</p>
<p>The poorly mitred corners<br />
on the trim over there,<br />
the stain on the carpet in there<br />
from wine which no longer flows,<br />
the grout which has worked it’s way free back there;<br />
these are all reminders of what is left to be done<br />
and what has been undone by our presence.</p>
<p>This house is a reflection of me, of us.</p>
