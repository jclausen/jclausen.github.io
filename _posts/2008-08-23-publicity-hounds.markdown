<p><em>by Jonathan Clausen</em></p>
<p>Zebras get a great deal of free publicity.  They are funny looking and who, off the tip of their tongue, knows of another animal that starts with the letter “Z”?  They do, however wear pinstripes which befit them as bookends for budding learners of the alphabet.</p>
<p>Cats and Dogs get top billing as well.   Not only are they within the first four letters of the alphabet, but they are gifted just as much from being simple to the ear and to the page.   Why, my very own daughter’s first word was  “kitty” - which, if you extrapolate her age and factor for cat years when she made this brilliant pronouncement, bears out my hypothesis completely.   They (cats and dogs, that is) are, naturally, top of mind to any child when the alphabet soup is on the menu.   Maybe that’s why we have so many of them as pets.</p>
<p>Contrast the noble canine to the lowly aardvark.  Most certainly he starts with an “A” and would seem a natural for some free, if albeit juvenile, press of his own.   But it is in the next letter of his name which causes a fundamental problem:  “a” again.  It is regrettable, however, that you simply cannot place the pitiful aardvark into a child’s bedtime story because of this misfortune of circumstance.   Any typical five year old worth her salt, in a most blatant attempt to stave off the impending lights-out, would use the much maligned aardvark as a quasi-intellectual springboard into a parental interrogation on the nuances of spelling in the English language.  We should nary forget his wretched, elongated snout and rat-esque tail, each of which provides fascination and begs questions of their own.   It is neither dogs nor cats which produce in me fitful dreams so much as the mere mention of one wretched aardvark near bedtime.</p>
<p>That brings me to “X”.  Most certainly we associate with the musicality of the xylophone which, while neither plant nor mammal, is all too familiar as emblematic for “x”.  The xylophone does, however, begs the question:  In the last century, even as we have discovered new flora and fauna, why have no living things been named begun with the letter “X”?</p>
<p>Surely, if they had, they would have gotten a great deal of free publicity.</p>
