<p>I make no secret of my admiration for Peter Brook and his life's work.   I think he is a gifted artist with an exceptional mind.   I've referred to his seminal work, <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0684829576%26tag=blogezods-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0684829576%253FSubscriptionId=0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2">The Empty Space</a></cite> in <a href="http://jonclausen.com/2008/02/directing-journal-six-characters-in-search-of-a-holy-theatre/">a previous post</a> and it has deeply influenced my own philosophies on Theatre.</p>
<p>When I learned that his staging of five of Samuel Beckett's short plays (entitled <cite>Fragments</cite> would be making its only US stop on a World Tour, it was a given that I wanted to see it.   My wife and I attended the February 8th <a href="http://www.chicagoshakes.com/main.taf?p=2,17,7">performance at Chicago Shakespeare</a> and, I'm very happy to say, I wasn't disappointed.   It's one thing to watch Beckett staged a University or Regional level, it's another entirely to watch it staged by actors who are truly transformational in their abilities and a director who was close to the playwright.</p>
<p>After seeing Brook's staging I am convinced that where most directors miss the boat when staging a work by Samuel Beckett, is focusing far too much on the existentialist philosophy which flows through his plays and not enough on the absurdist comedy which is so well written with a mind for the environment of the theatre.  Beckett published works for Television, Radio, and Theatre as well as essays for periodicals, but it is the theatre and it's communal audience which provides the most powerful vehicle for his body of work.</p>
<p>In addition to the outstanding performances from the actors, one of the things I found most interesting, in restrospect, was his choice for the order of the plays to be performed.   The playing order was as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rough for Theatre I</li>
<li>Rockaby</li>
<li>Act Without Words II</li>
<li>Neither</li>
<li>Come and Go</li>
</ol>

<p><cite>Rough for Theatre</cite>, <cite>Act Without Words</cite> and <cite>Come and Go</cite> are all very light and funny pieces, while <cite>Rockaby</cite> and <cite>Neither</cite> are dark and disturbing.  Brooke's choice of order ensures that the audience is drawn in through comedy before taking a trip to some of the darkest material that Beckett has to offer.  Doing so Brook avoids alienation by opening with an accessible, understandable piece which allows the audience to "get their feet wet" before being moved to the core by the alienating death knell of Rockaby (powerfully performed by <a href="http://www.chicagoshakes.com/main.taf?p=2,17,7,1,5,2">Kathryn Hunter</a> of Harry Potter movie fame).</p>
<p>Brook repeats the process with the uplifting <cite>Act Without Words II</cite> and the endless closing doors of <cite>Neither</cite> before finally closing on the warm and light Come and Go.   When staging a group of short plays over the course of an evening, the timing of the works as they are presented is crucial to both the actors and the audience getting their best from each other.  Those staging festivals of short plays would do well to learn from Brook's example.</p>
