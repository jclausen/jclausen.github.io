<p>This book review from the Times is worth saving, as much because it contains <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/books/review/McCarter-t.html?_r=1&ei=5088&en=f368714ba874de4b&ex=1361595600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">some potent insights into David Mamet</a> in as much as the biography it chronicles does:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/books/review/McCarter-t.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&ei=5088&en=f368714ba874de4b&ex=1361595600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss"><p>
But the definitive Mamet biography will above all need to give a full accounting of his voice. Mamet, according to Mosher, “worked the iambic pentameter out of the vernacular of the underclass.” For all the comparisons to Pinter, there is nothing like Mamet’s profane poetry in modern drama. No one writing for the stage today has done more to make playgoers listen, to remind them that theater remains, at heart, a verse form fallen on prosy hard times. How did he do it? The answer is a Rosebud that still needs finding.
