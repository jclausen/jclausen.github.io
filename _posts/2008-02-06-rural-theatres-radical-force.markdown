<p>Guardian theatre blog <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/theatre/2008/02/the_radical_force_of_rural_the.html">makes some interesting observations on England's rural theatre</a> today:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 So it may come as a surprise to the rest of the country to hear that much of the work being made in rural England is new work for new audiences and is presented in different ways and times, through new partnerships. It doesn't call itself "radical" or "experimental" because, like everywhere else, these terms scare the audience. Nevertheless, freed from the restrictions of purpose-built theatres, many artists are experimenting with the way they tell their stories, creating new relationships with audiences and reinventing what contemporary theatre might look like. Indeed, I would contend that much of the future health of theatre relies on exploiting the discoveries being made in rural touring.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Lest we forget that the traditions of storytelling have their deepest roots in rural areas...  This subject of pushing the boundaries of rural theatre fascinates me, having grown up in a rural area, myself.  Despite stereotypes and assumptions to the contrary, rural theatre-goers are some of the most accepting and loyal patrons which any theatre can have.</p>
<p>While it's true that mainstream musicals, old stand-bys, and light comedies tend to be more well received as a whole by that demographic, I also think that the opportunity exists to present important, even controversial works, to those audiences - providing due diligence, communication, and an ongoing, healthy relationship with the community is part of package.</p>
