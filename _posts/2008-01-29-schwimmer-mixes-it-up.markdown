<p>... <a href="http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2008/01/david-schwimmer.html#comments">with the Chicago theatre blog and it's patrons</a>.   Say what you will about his acting or the commerciality of his artistic choices, Chicago hasn't had a mainstream actor who has helped to lift up the level of it's theatre scene - both artistically and financially - since Sinise, Malkovich, and the Steppenwolf.  His work with the Lookingglass in the past 20 years has helped to make that company one of the stalwarts of the Chi-town theatre scene.  They consistently make bold artistic choices which, in my opinion, serve to challenge the rest of the smaller companies in the city to keep up.</p>
