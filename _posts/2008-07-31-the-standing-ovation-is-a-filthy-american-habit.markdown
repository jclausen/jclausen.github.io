<p>Guardian Theatre blog, <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/theatre/2008/07/standing_ovation.html">rails against an increasingly frequent occurrence in the British theatre</a>: the standing ovation.  Frankly, I agree:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/theatre/2008/07/standing_ovation.html"><p>
The argument against the standing ovation is simple. If you do it for virtually everything, it soon becomes valueless. I can think of a handful of occasions over the years when, if I were a paying customer, I too would probably have risen to my feet: an Olivier performance; a Sondheim premiere; a farewell to a singing legend such as Ethel Merman or Barbara Cook. But a standing-ovation should be a rare and choice event. Currently, however, it is turning into a hollow gesture in which audiences seek to transform perfectly decent plays and musicals into earth-shattering occasions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>More and more, as an actor and audience member, I feel that the expectations on both sides of the stage regarding a possible ovation needlessly create an uncomfortable situation for everyone.  The actors feel, incorrectly, that the audience was not engaged unless they receive one and the audience is divided in whether they choose to rise to their feet or remain seated.  IMHO, this moment of tension after the play ends is unnecessary and casts a pall over the experience to what should be a unifying experience between members of the production and their audience.</p>
