<p><a href="http://www.avltheatre.com/forte/2008/01/the_state_of_political_theatre.html">Theatreforte is covering</a> an interesting, ongoing, debate about the viability of political theatre.  Stemming, in part, from a NYC company's <a href="http://www.noahdiamond.com/zeitgeist2030.html">decision to cancel a show</a> because of concerns of relevancy and their own idea that their work sends the wrong message.  A columnist in the SF Weekly weighs in with the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>
With the mass, commercialized media of television, the Internet, talk radio, and movies possessing an exponentially greater ability to reach voters, many people are apt to dismiss the intensely localized, live medium of theater as irrelevant to the democratic process. The fact that most political dramas espouse a liberal point of view and play largely to like-minded audiences only serves to further ghettoize the art form.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While, I think this statement may be throwing the baby out with the bath water to a degree, I think there is some validity in the argument.  The primary problem, IMHO, is that our historical models of political activism in the theatre don't necessarily apply in the age of film - in that, I believe the SF Weekly columnist is correct.  That doesn't, however, mean a political theatre isn't relevant or potentially viable, but it does mean that we need to explore - through works and stagings - different methods to send those messages in a manner that is wholly unique to the theatre:  the urgency of the present, rather than film's documentation of past events.</p>
<p>Live theatre is still capable of dynamic revelation and audience insight in way which film will never be capable of.  If we are to bring back the viability of political theatre to a diverse audience (i.e. - one not simply consisting of the like-minded) we need to explore ways to present the message and dramatic action in a way that leverages the strengths of the medium and yet appeals to an audience on many different levels.</p>
