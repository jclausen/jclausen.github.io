<p>One of the classes I'm taking this semester is Creative Writing.   While I've done a ton of writing and still do every day in one form or another, I've never made the attempt to expand that creatively - at least not with the intention of publishing in any shape or form.</p>
<p>I've decided to add a <a href="http://jonclausen.com/category/poetry/" title="Poetry by me">Poetry category</a> here to, at the very least, capture and document some of my work in that class that I would be proud to share.   I don't know that I will ever be a poet, but at least I can write things that are "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ish-Peter-H-Reynolds/dp/076362344X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1201623186&amp;sr=8-1" title="Ish">poem-ish</a>."</p>
<p>Hope you <a href="http://jonclausen.com/category/poetry/">enjoy</a>.</p>
