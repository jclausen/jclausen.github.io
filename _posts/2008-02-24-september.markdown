<p><strong>S</strong>eptember streams steam in early morning.<br />
Snowbirds stand shoulder to shoulder in preparation for the snow.<br />
Some songbirds, however, are adverse:<br />
steadfastly singing summer songs.</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>ver changing events of weather ease through<br />
the erudite forests which soon will be exfoliated.<br />
An evening walk evokes in one both spring and fall.<br />
<strong><br /></strong><strong>P</strong>erpetual pictures of a summer soon to pass<br />
posess a fleeting, poignant, palpable loss of time.<br />
Pine boughs will soon put forth their pins.<strong><br /></strong> <strong><br /></strong><strong>T</strong>iptoeing to a tune of inner urgency,<br />
tripping over toys which talk (thanks tonton)<br />
and to the coffee pot, two teaspoons, and a tumbler.<br />
<strong><br /></strong><strong>E</strong>ulogizing year’s past events though, even still,<br />
there’s time for espisodic encounters with a morning or two<br />
of easing out a line into the water as the evening turns to dawn.<br />
<strong><br /></strong><strong>M</strong>ost of all is the memory of a moment;<br />
a miracle of myself and of my wife.<br />
Madly driving, much too fast, to meet her<br />
<strong><br /></strong><strong>B</strong>irth.<br />
A baby born to both of us, blessed we were<br />
with a bouncing, babbling, even bawling bitsy one.<br />
<strong><br /></strong><strong>E</strong>ven as she ever grows and changes,<br />
I end each day with awe and endless wonder,<br />
<strong><br /></strong><strong>r</strong>eminded of the rapt and restless person<br />
who readily and constantly demands my recognition.<br />
This rosy-cheeked rascal of four years,<br />
punctuates my remembrances of</p>
<p><strong>September</strong>.</p>
