<p>A cloud stirs on the horizon<br />
in Autumn and in Spring.<br />
Amber waves are quartered,<br />
then plowed under for the season.<br />
It so happens it is fitting.</p>
<p>I’m of the dust you see.</p>
<p>Vents placed up above<br />
witness drama forged below.<br />
A love joined much too young<br />
brings anger, sadness, accusation.<br />
A right hand palms the metal<br />
the left hand cradles the wood-<br />
-en shoulders of my sister.<br />
The eyes of four short years<br />
clouded, shrouded, grey.<br />
Ears witness to the struggle<br />
that will drive us all away.</p>
<p>I’m of tears, you see.</p>
<p>Horizontal yields to vertical<br />
northbound on this ride<br />
which I have witnessed faithfully<br />
far side of a hundred times.<br />
These lands, they are both fertile<br />
and barren at the once;<br />
fit for cattle, not for corn.<br />
For legionnaires who lift, salute<br />
the casket of a brother<br />
from wars since fought and ended<br />
against April’s wet grey canvas.</p>
<p>I’m of these hills, you see.</p>
<p>Forgotten reservations, there’s frustration on this plain<br />
of chieftains shedding silently for those still born in shame<br />
of alcohol’s temptation, life’s station, thirst for libation<br />
of some comfort.<br />
Life for them is quaint-icised, compartmentalized<br />
objectified, vilified, circumcised against their will.</p>
<p>I’m of them too, you see.</p>
<p>Your toe is frozen, Grandfather<br />
They must amputate.<br />
But in that’s your redemption,<br />
reflection, a chance it seems<br />
to binge on broad acceptance,<br />
to breathe God, become redeemed.<br />
Even as you falter, when breathing comes too strained,<br />
you’re baseball in the summer, football in the Fall,<br />
a circus parade of shriners on scooters much too small,<br />
and laughter, debts forgiven, applause for sons of man<br />
is all part of your legacy. In that, I understand</p>
<p>I’m of love you see, unconditional and kind.</p>
<p>Pioneers, once westward, roamed these breathless spaces.<br />
No trees were seen for miles,<br />
no silos broke the promised line<br />
of their horizon.<br />
Eastward now does call<br />
their grandest sons and daughters<br />
traditions will be lost,<br />
land here no longer prospers.<br />
The exit has arrived, four lanes now bend to two<br />
and soon will turn to gravel, which brings me back to see:<br />
my roots are nowhere,everywhere.</p>
<p>My life’s been lived along this road,<br />
I’m of it too, you see.</p>
