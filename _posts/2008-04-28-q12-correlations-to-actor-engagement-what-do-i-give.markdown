<p>
The second phase of the "<a href="http://betweensilences.com/2008/04/q12-correlations-to-actor-engagement-introduction/">journey of engagement</a>" for every actor is their ability to satisfactorily answer the question "What Do I Give?" satisfactorily as it relates to their role in the production.  In Gallup's Q12, the following questions are grouped as part of this second phase of the journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>At work, I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day.</li>
<li>In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work.</li>
<li>My supervisor, or someone at work, seems to care about me as a person.</li>
<li>There is someone at work who encourages my development.</li>
</ul>
<p>
At first glance, these questions may seem like they would be more appropriate in the "Do I belong?" or "What do I get?" phases of the journey, however with closer inspection the questions are framed in such a way to measure the way the individual feels about responses to their personal output.  In the sense of actor/director relationships, this step is critical in allowing actors to feel like the choice they are making early on in the process of developing a role are, even if incorrect, being recognized and rewarded.  This doesn't mean they shouldn't be corrected if making choices which aren't in keeping with the directors vision of the role and/or production, but does mean that recognition of their effort and the emotional availability for the part are important in allowing them to feel that the rehearsal process is a safe place for them to develop creatively.</p>
<p>These questions also deal directly with the fundamental positive feelings the individual actor has from their director and other members of the production staff.   Actors are among the most emotionally sensitive human beings on the planet and, most especially early on in the process,  require a higher number of "deposits" into their "emotional bank accounts" to prepare for increasing number of physical and emotional withdrawals which will need to be made during final weeks of production and into the performance.</p>
<p>Overall, this phase of the journey is less a measurement of how the actor sees themselves as part of the production but is rather a tangible way to measure the the way in which their personal output is valued and received by the director, other members of the cast, and crew.</p>
