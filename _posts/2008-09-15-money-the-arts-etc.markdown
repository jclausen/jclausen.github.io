<p><a href="http://parabasis.typepad.com/blog/2008/09/money-the-arts-etc.html">David Cote</a> touches on a tough subject:  what happens to the arts in an economic crisis:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://parabasis.typepad.com/blog/2008/09/money-the-arts-etc.html"><p>
Obviously, the most direct impact will be financial. I was speaking a friend who works for an Off-Broadway theater who told me "we were waiting for a grant from Lehman... I have no idea what's going to happen with that". That's not good. Corporations are going to be donating less. Individual giving is going to fall. Â It's going to be a tough climate.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I continue to mull over some of my ideas on what a sustainable (and I don't just mean that from an environmental perspective) arts sector looks like, I think there needs to be a more holistic balance between the donations received and how they are allocated annually.  Much of the way money is spent in the NFP revolves around the amount of cash-on-hand at the end of the year - a direct result of the tax requirements imposed upon them.  That needs to change and include longer term financial strategies which allow for both stability in the structure of our institutions and greater artistic freedom from the demands of the box office. Unless this changes, the NFP arts sector will always be a slave to the fluctuations of the market.</p>
