<p>Another thought-provoking and relative post from Laura Axelrod, <a href="http://www.gaspjournal.com/2008/09/you-the-needs-of-your-audience.html"><cite>You & the Needs of Your Audience</cite></a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.gaspjournal.com/2008/09/you-the-needs-of-your-audience.html"><p>
Some people might mistake my call for cultural relevance as an urging for agit-prop. Nothing could be further from the truth. It saddens me that there are those who would dismiss these essays with that response. It also would be very simple for the artist to dig a hole and hide from the undercurrent. Why sully yourself with ephemeral matters? Elections come and go; money is for someone else to understand.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, while you can wash your hands of these problems, your audience cannot. Instead of paying attention to your composition, their thoughts may drift back to their bank accounts. Will they be able to access their money? How are they going to justify buying tickets with these kind of money troubles?
