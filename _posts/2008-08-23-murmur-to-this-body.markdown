<p><em>by Jonathan Clausen</em></p>
<p>Breathe deeply of clean air<br />
when you find it.<br />
I must have it to turn<br />
blue to crimson,<br />
to bring life back to<br />
dying members of this host,<br />
allowing myself once again to<br />
revel in the slowness<br />
that is the persistent beat of a drum<br />
to which we both march.</p>
<p>Dance, play, run freely;<br />
it makes my muscles stronger<br />
to run a race of determined length.</p>
<p>Open me up to the deserving.<br />
It is well and good<br />
that your system is a closed one,<br />
but my muscle of metaphors<br />
wants to be shared.<br />
Un-gifted, I atrophy and become hardened.</p>
<p>Treat me gently;<br />
hope that others will do the same,<br />
but don’t fear me.<br />
I have wounds which fester,<br />
and may never heal,<br />
but endure these.<br />
Potential rewards<br />
tip scales on periodic pains.</p>
<p>You’ve told all this to me,<br />
and to yourself, more than once.<br />
I’ve heard you, and<br />
what is more important<br />
is that I have to believe you.</p>
