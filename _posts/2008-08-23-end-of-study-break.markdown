<p><em>by Jonathan Clausen</em></p>
<p>It’s as if I am aging in reverse.<br />
Rekindled passions, dormant for many seasons,<br />
speak to me now and ask questions:<br />
was what once seemed right, instead<br />
necessary protection from an aching heart?<br />
From poverty? From pain?<br />
Shall I try once again to cover myself in<br />
the sheath of success which<br />
has, in the past,<br />
wrapped me with its gilded fabric of a duller hue?</p>
<p>I think I will ask my old friends.<br />
They once were accomplice to my greatest escape.<br />
Yet their pages are yellowed:<br />
their brittle stacks faded from passage of time.</p>
<p>Perhaps, instead, I should put them away;<br />
safe for later days, poised for fresh eyes.<br />
The faces on the planks of this shelf<br />
have changed much in 15 years.<br />
Some familiarity remains.<br />
“Hello my friends, my comforts, my teachers<br />
I’d like to catch up.<br />
It seems I have a moment.”</p>
