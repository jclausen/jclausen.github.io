<p>From <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/theatre/2008/05/for_editors_12.html">Guardian Theatre Blog</a>, A snippet to save for my ongoing fascination with the subject of "community" as it relates to theatre.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/theatre/2008/05/for_editors_12.html"><p>
Participation is very much the buzzword in theatre at the moment - indeed, for many people, it is their route into theatre, whether as practitioners or as enthusiastic and adventurous audiences. The number of funded projects involving the community is on the rise. But what happens if the community decide that they don't actually want to take part?
