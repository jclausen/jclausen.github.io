<p>As <a href="http://jonclausen.com/2008/04/q12-correlations-to-actor-engagement-introduction/">discussed previously</a>, there are direct correlations to the journey of engagement undertaken by employees in an organization and actors/crew in a production to the Gallup School of Management's Q12 process.   The solid foundation of that process of engagement is the the actors ability to answer the question "What Do I Get?" in the affirmative.</p>
<p><img title="employee-engagement.jpg" src="/images/2008/04/employee-engagement.jpg" alt="employee-engagement.jpg" align="right" />Marcus Buckingham, author of "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0684852861%26tag=blogezods-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0684852861%253FSubscriptionId=0PZ7TM66EXQCXFVTMTR2">First Break All The Rules</a>" describes the process as akin to the acclimation steps which a mountain climber undergoes in adjusting to life in high altitude in preparation for ascent to the summit.    Unless the climber acclimates and adjusts to life at base camp, camp 1, etc. along the route to the summit, they are unable to emotionally and physically handle subsequent steps along the way. The two questions of the Gallup Q12 which relate to the "What Do I Get?" are:</p>
<ol>
<li>I know what is expected of me at work.</li>
<li>I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right.</li>
</ol>
<p>Drawing the connections to actors in a production, knowing what is expected encompasses the basics like script, their role in the director's vision of the production - in short all of the details which will allow them to clearly feel, at the end of the first or second rehearsal, that they have a clear set of attainable expectations that they have the ability to meet.   Some of this is, naturally, internalized, as the actor views their own role, but much of it should be placed on the director in the way he or she frames up the aspirational objectives for the cast in the rehearsal process.   A clear statement of vision and purpose for the production is essential in a establishing the shared language between the directors and actors which will be used later on in the rehearsal process.</p>
<p>The materials and equipment question involves not only physical tools like the script and the schedule, but also involves intangibles such as clear definition of the playing space and environment, availability of rehearsal props as necessary, and the actors general sense that the director is responsive to their needs and an actor in helping to get them or help them get what they need to perform well.</p>
<p>What is important to recognize in context is that every production starts out with a need to address the selfish interests of the individual members of the ensemble before moving on to the selfless goals which are what will ultimately make the creative process collaborative and successful.   It is critical that the director is cognizant of the need to address the individuality of the actors on their own terms.  A "one size fits all" approach is counter-productive and may greatly hinder the actors' ability to effectively answer the question "What Do I Get?"  for themselves.</p>
