Christopher
        Wal-
-Ken isanenigma
   wrapped in a parody of himself.
The wild-
                -eyed question of his
sin-
        -cerity
                remains unanswered.
Yale schooled him, yet
far away from his ivy-
                        -league
he pulls atimepiecefromhisanusâ€¦
Still, somehow, we              love
the hell. out of him. 
        for that?
