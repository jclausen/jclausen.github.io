<p>What looks like an <a href="http://www.currency.com.au/search.aspx?type=author&amp;author=Phyllida+Shaw+and+Cathy+Hunt">interesting paper</a> from across the pond, via <a href="http://theatrenotes.blogspot.com/2008/01/sustaining-arts.html">theatre notes</a>.:</p>
<blockquote><p> It's well worth threading through the complexities of the argument: it may sometimes be a little dry, but it's packed with useful background, and is an illuminating survey of government arts policy, both here and in the UK. At base, this is a passionate advocacy of the place of the arts in contemporary society, and an intelligent argument for a more holistic and multi-dimensional approach to arts funding. (We're talking private as well as public investment). In particular, arguing that we should attempt to think more long-term about our arts ecology</p></blockquote>
<p>"Arts Ecology."  I think that this is a term with an underlying truth to it.  I'll have to pony up for the paper at some point when it has a higher degree of relevance in my studies.</p>
