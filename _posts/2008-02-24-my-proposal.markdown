<p>Join me</p>
<p>on an adventure for all time.</p>
<p>None have pierced this shell</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>this door has been left open for many</p>
<p>hopefuls who collapsed before the threshold.</p>
<p>Another may</p>
<p>never</p>
<p>come along once we have begun.</p>
<p>Love is just a part</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>usually is mistaken to be some</p>
<p>sacred guarantee of everlasting.</p>
<p>Would that were trueâ€¦</p>
