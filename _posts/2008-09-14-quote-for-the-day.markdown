<blockquote>...if there are minor arts and major arts, the latter being the ones that contain the former, there will be therefore a sovereign art, which will contain all of the other arts and sciences, and whose field of action and concern will include all of the fields of action of all the other arts and all the other sciences. This sovereign art, of course, will be the one whose laws rule over the relations of men in their totality.Â  That is, Politics.</p>
<p>Nothing is alien to Politics, because nothing is alien to the superior art that rules the relations among men.</p></blockquote>
