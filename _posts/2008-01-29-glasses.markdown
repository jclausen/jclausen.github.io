<p>I once wore glasses<br />
Sometimes I still do<br />
When I would go outside,<br />
on a cold winters day,<br />
they would fog over;<br />
blinding me.</p>
<p>So I removed them, changed lenses<br />
with new ones placed into my eyes,<br />
not in front of them.<br />
Now I see differently, but the same.</p>
<p>I have tried many different lenses in 35 years.<br />
Some dried and clouded faster than others.<br />
Some caused my vision to deteriorate even further.<br />
A few even caused my sight to flip-flop:<br />
my right eye took on the prescription of the left.</p>
<p>It seems it’s time for a new prescription,<br />
which necessitates an evaluation as well.<br />
What will be the verdict?</p>
<p>Am I better off or worse than before?<br />
What correction is needed<br />
so that I may see clearly again;<br />
as cleanly, clearly as perhaps I<br />
only last did upon exiting the womb?</p>
<p>Get real, self.<br />
These eyes are not old, but are getting older.<br />
They still see clearly, yet it’s true that while<br />
each year brings a stronger prescription<br />
to focus these eyes, I can still see clearly.<br />
I guess that’s all that really matters.<br />
That is, until someday<br />
I’m blinded once again.</p>
