<p><em>by Jonathan Clausen</em></p>
<p>Her heavy accent breaks my reverie,<br />
my self-absorption gives way<br />
to abashment.<br />
She is a teacher in the old style:<br />
herself, long ago, a fugitive<br />
from a Holocaust which<br />
once fell upon old Europe.</p>
<p>She firmly corrects my twelve year-old hands<br />
with hers withered and bulging,<br />
with the ravages of wars and age,<br />
attacking this instrument before us both.<br />
I am reminded to hold my fingers properly:<br />
not flat and flaccid,<br />
but arched and ready.</p>
<p>Each week<br />
I have come to dread this moment:<br />
the contrast of her age and mine,<br />
the lack of coolness in it all,<br />
hiding this from my friends<br />
who play baseball instead<br />
or skateboard.</p>
<p>In the opacity of a Grand Piano<br />
our differences are reflected.<br />
As soon as is allowed,<br />
I will leave her for good,<br />
and will later regret<br />
this gift I once rejected.</p>
