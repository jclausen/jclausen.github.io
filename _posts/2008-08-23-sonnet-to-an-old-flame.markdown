<p><em>by Jonathan Clausen</em></p>
<p>Even now as years provide me distance,<br />
and thunder, bolts of lightning, are replaced<br />
by new relationships, loves, lives and children<br />
at times, I find my thoughts return to you.</p>
<p>I do not long to rekindle an old romance.<br />
In truth, my life is richer now by far.<br />
And yet, it seems our memory passes history’s<br />
test; as time rememb’red finds new meaning.</p>
<p>Perhaps this blossoms from growing nostalgia<br />
for simpler times which distance makes more pure<br />
before bold hope gave way to cynicism,<br />
when all ideals gleamed new and possible.</p>
<p>So, old flame, I cast out thoughts of hate,<br />
the bitter pain of parting and my tears.<br />
Instead I’ll forego wrongs to elevate<br />
remembrances of me, and you, and us;<br />
I wish you boundless joy, much happiness.</p>
