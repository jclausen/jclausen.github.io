<p>Though the specifics are directed at internet audiences, <a href="http://zefrank.com">Ze Frank</a> <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/audience/">asks colleagues and students to answer the question</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
When you make things with an audience in mind, do you have internal representations of that audience to help guide you in the process? Are you in dialogue with a cast of proto-audience members that somehow represent different facets of your perceived audience? Are there little homunculi that provide editorial voices different from your own? Do you interact with them verbally or do you bounce things off of some sort of an emotional surface? Did some sort of averaging form them or were they inspired by particular moments of feedback? Do they have a shape? How would you describe their points of view? What do they look like? Do they have names? Are there ones you trust more than others? Are there ones you avoid?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/audience/">the answers</a> are, mostly, applicable to the theatre as well...</p>
