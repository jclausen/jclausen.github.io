<p>Yes the high school theatre staple <cite>Our Town</cite>. Really. The <a href="http://www.lookingglasstheatre.org/content/">Lookingglass</a> has a version of Thornton Wilder's <cite>Our Town</cite> on deck for this next season, but Chris Jones has found a version on stage in Chicago that <a href="http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2008/05/david-cromers-a.html">he considers outstanding</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/the_theater_loop/2008/05/david-cromers-a.html"><p>
David Cromer has directed some distinguished Chicago productions in his career: “Orson’s Shadow” at Steppenwolf; “Come Back Little Sheba” at Shattered Globe; and Next Theatre’s “The Adding Machine,” for which his direction snagged a bucket-load of prestigious award nominations this week in New York.<br />
<br/><br/><br />
But I think Cromer’s brilliantly revisionist and generally astounding new production of Thornton Wilder’s “Our Town” at The Hypocrites is his masterwork to date. It’s better than any of the above. And it all takes place in a Wicker Park basement for 20 bucks a ticket.<br />
<br/><br/><br />
In the jaw-dropping third act, which makes some truly shocking and inspired conceptual choices that are best experienced without foreknowledge, I found myself speaking the words “Oh, my God” to no one. And despite eccentricities, I’m not that given to inappropriate interjections. It’s just that this “Our Town” hit me that hard.<br />
<br/></br/><br />
If your tastes run to shows that make you stare right in the face of your own mortality and inability to prioritize what and who really matters in life, your own petty obsessions and jealousies, then cancel whatever you’re doing tonight and go and see this show.
