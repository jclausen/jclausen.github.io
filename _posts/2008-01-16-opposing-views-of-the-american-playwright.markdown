<p>An interesting, if heated, debate taking place between playwrights.   <a href="http://arts.guardian.co.uk/theatre/drama/story/0,,2241063,00.html">Neil LaBute starts the argument over at Guardian Arts</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> We are small writers in America these days, writing tiny plays about tiny ideas with two to four characters, so that we get produced and nobody loses any money. American playwrights have been workshopped and "staged-readinged" to death, and we are now a fearful bunch who add sitcom lines to our dramas and tie things up at the end so that folks can walk out of theatres smiling. We watch the studios make films about Iraq that don't sell tickets and we steer clear of the subject.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/theatre/2008/01/flying_the_flag_for_american_t.html">George Hunka, fires back from the Guardian blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> In his first paragraph, Neil lists six British playwrights he admires for their uncompromising vision. In the body of his essay, though, he approvingly cites Christopher Shinn, Wallace Shawn, David Mamet, Tony Kushner, David Rabe and Amiri Baraka as fellow countrymen he admires and looked up to as a student in that hard-scrabble, tough-talking environment, the MFA program at the University of Kansas. Half a dozen for the Brits; half a dozen for the Yanks. So there doesn't seem to be any playwright gap, at least not in Neil's world.</p></blockquote>
<p>IMHO, I think it's both and neither.   This may seem like a cop out, but it seems to me that there is a deep crisis of insecurity in American theatre as it continues to compare itself with film and television. This has led to an increasing number of American playwrights who write "screenplays for the stage."  In doing so they attempt to address subtle issues in a manner which could be most powerfully portrayed on the big screen.  Even our musicals emulate this medium - when they don't outright copy it.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the British tradition, which places emphasis on Television and Film as vehicles of mass entertainment, but which - in part due to the resonating influence and national pride for the bard - holds up and celebrates the raw power and physicality of the stage medium as distinct and unique in what it is capable of evoking in communion with an audience.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this, as Hunka states, though we need to make sure we hold those exceptions up to future playwrights so that they don't fall into the trap of writing with one eye toward the movie version of their work.  Good, bad or otherwise, that may well be where their work is enshrined in due course but let that be the film director's job to figure out how...</p>
