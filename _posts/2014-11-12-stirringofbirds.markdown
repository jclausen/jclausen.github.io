*by Jon Clausen*

**Smile:**  
Stirringofbirds, [a poet said](http://hellopoetry.com/poem/1586/i-have-found-what-you-are-like/).  
  
**Touch:**  
a shiver, a quake  
known only to me.  
  
**Arms:**  
fire where they came rest,  
instantly recalled.  
  
**Distance:**  
the room ceases to be.  
your purpose:not me,   
yet the arc exists.  
  
**Knowing:**  
that we will not be.  
Timing was never our thing.
